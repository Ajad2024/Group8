## Space Management Tool
## Problem / Claim
The tool addresses the challenge of verifying and optimizing space allocation in buildings, ensuring compliance with functional requirements and regulatory standards. It also provides actionable insights for improving spatial efficiency, identifying underutilized areas, and resolving design non-compliance.
Where the Problem Was Found
The issue of inefficient use of space and failure to meet standards is commonly encountered in architectural design, facility management, and regulatory reviews. These problems typically surface during the design and construction stages, where discrepancies between planned space allocations and their actual implementation can result in challenges related to functionality, safety, and regulatory compliance.
## Description of the Tool
Our first tool, extracts space’s attributes about the different room types, as dimensions, location and capacity, being our basis for the second tool. 
The second tool extracts, analyzes, and visualizes spatial data from building models in IFC format. Evaluates compliance with predefined standards, as the minimum required area for offices, meeting rooms and auditoriums according with the capacity of any type of room and generates reports and visualizations to highlight spaces that fail to meet the standards.
The value proposition of the tool lies in its efficiency, transparency, and optimization. It streamlines the process of evaluating space compliance and planning, saving time and reducing complexity. By offering clear visualizations and comprehensive reports, it ensures transparency, keeping stakeholders well-informed. Additionally, the tool enhances optimization by identifying opportunities to improve space utilization and refine design strategies, ultimately leading to more effective and compliant building layouts.

## Instructions to Run the Tool

 ## 1.	Prepare the Input File:
   •	Ensure the building model is in IFC format containing detailed spatial information.
## 2.	Upload the IFC File:
   •	Provide the file as input to the tool.
   •	If the model is complete and includes all essential data, the user does not need to rely on an Excel file, as our tool can directly extract room areas from the IFC file. However, due to the 
      limitations of the provided report, we had to create an Excel file with information sourced from an external program to obtain the required areas. This is why we have two separate codes: 
      one tailored for the incomplete report and another for a well-structured and complete report.

## 3.	Run the Analysis:
   •	The tool will extract space attributes and perform compliance checks against the predefined requirements.
## 4.	Review Outputs:
   •	View compliance reports and visualizations of the building spaces.
## 5.	Interact and Modify:
   •	Adjust parameters or space requirements if necessary and re-run the analysis.
## 6.	Export Results:
   •	Save the compliance report or visualization outputs for documentation or further review.

## Advanced Building Design
## Which Stage Would the Tool Be Useful?
The tool is particularly valuable in Stage B (Design Development), where it ensures spatial planning is validated and meets compliance requirements during the early phases of design. It is also highly effective in Stage C (Technical Design), helping to confirm that the final design aligns seamlessly with functional requirements and adheres to regulatory standards.
## Which Subjects Might Use It?
The tool is useful for architecture, ensuring spatial arrangements align with design intent and usability criteria; engineering, analyzing dimensions and volumes for structural and safety compliance; facility management, optimizing space usage and planning during operations; and construction management, verifying that as-built models match the planned designs.
## Required Information in the Model
The tool relies on specific data within the IFC model, which posed a significant challenge for us since the model we are working with lacks critical information, such as the areas for key zones.
## 1.	Space Attributes:
   •	Space name, type, and level (1st Tool)
   •	Dimensions (length, width, height) and gross area (2nd tool)
## 2.	Compliance Standards:
   •	Predefined benchmarks for spatial allocation and regulatory requirements (2nd tool)
## By addressing these components, the tool ensures a comprehensive analysis of space management.
