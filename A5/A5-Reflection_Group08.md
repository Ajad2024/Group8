## FEEDBACK FOR OUR TOOL: PEER REVIEW FOR GROUP 8
## SUMMARY:
The project generally received positive feedback. The aim of the project was to optimize office area use, a crucial task in large construction and building projects. By optimizing the square meter price per office worker, costs can be reduced while maintaining productivity and comfort. However, a key challenge is gathering accurate data on floor areas, especially for office spaces. In an ideal world, this information would be easily accessible and standardized, simplifying the optimization process. It also focuses on addressing space management and organization, with the main difficulty being determining accurate floor area, slab types, and the number of slabs. Identifying furniture and extracting floor information, especially when calculating space usage floor by floor, has proven difficult. Due to those problems, the tool had to be changed to some extent, and the new version is focusing mainly on checking the workspace requirements. During the project development, BIMVision has been explored as a more effective tool than Blender.

## Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended :
At the beginning of the course, I did not really know much about IFC and OpenBIM, and now at the end of the course, I think I am probably a Level 2 Analyst.
## What else do you still need to learn?
Since OpenBIM has many capabilities and applications in the industry and it is a new concept for me I have a lot of things that I still need to learn and process. For now, I would like to work a little more with OpenBIM in order to enhance my level of knowledge into a Level 3 Analyst.
## How you might use OpenBIM in the future?
I think I will use it in my professional life and probably my thesis. More specifically, it seems like there is a trend moving towards open-source tools and OpenBIM can provide and improve information exchange between all the different parties of a project, leading to building better buildings and reduction of costs and human errors. Additionally, I believe that because it makes processes more effective and automatic, it is an asset that can advantageously be incorporated into a master's thesis.
## Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?
The process of the course has supported the progress in future BIM-related work when the case is to work with BIM models in general. Seems like OpenBIM and Python have many options that can be useful to make a program run automatically instead of doing many things manually. Although the project made  an interesting basis, it was also quite difficult. However, due to our limited time with this course, it is unlikely that it will enable us to answer or define questions that would be used for our thesis.
## Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?
The freedom to choose our case led to a better result in pursuing my interests. It would have been good to have some framework though as the process sometimes seemed a little unclear. Furthermore, I didn’t know what I could program later on. All in all, freedom was good, but some guidance would be helpful in order to get in the right way and make a tool that fulfills both the aim and the goal.

## Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?
For inexperienced coders like myself, the number of tools was helpful for me to start programming and learn about new concepts. However, some of the topics and tools feel a bit rushed making it hard to really understand the tool's capabilities. It would have been more helpful if the teaching team could find or create some videos explaining different codes, tools, and concepts in order for us be to prepared before class so we wouldn't have to wait for a TA to explain and personally help. 
## Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?
Yes probably, although I am not sure yet what my thesis will be since it is my first term. In general, OpenBIM and IFC are developing and have many opportunities, and coding is something necessary nowadays because offers a great number of opportunities as it makes different processes more effective and automatic, which makes it an asset that can advantageously be incorporated into a master thesis.

## Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?
Definitely, yes. Without a doubt, it seems like there is a trend moving towards open-source tools and OpenBIM has entered the scene of information tools and can provide and improve information exchange between all the different parties of a project. The implementation of OpenBIM in the building industry will help in order to build better and more sustainable buildings and reduce costs.


## Conclude the journey through A1-A5
In Assignment A1, we explored OpenBIM and IFC models, extracting information using OpenBIM tools. We collaborated on developing an OpenBIM tool in Python within a code repository and applied our programming skills to create a tool for our domain. In Assignment A2, we identified a use case for tool development in A3. We modeled a BIM use case based on challenges from an OpenBIM project analysis using BPMN, creating a diagram to describe all stages and processes. In Assignment A3, we developed a tool to optimize space allocation in buildings, ensuring compliance with functional requirements and regulations. In Assignment A4, we enhanced our tool to extract, analyze, and visualize spatial data from IFC models. It evaluates room compliance with standards, generating reports and visualizations for non-compliant spaces. We presented the tool to other groups, received feedback, and created a tutorial on the process. In Assignment A5, we reflected on the learning experience and the process outcomes of the project. More specifically, how the process influenced us, what was our peer feedback and what are the chances of using OpenBIM in the future. 
The work in A1 did not have much to do with A2-A4. A2 and A3 on the other hand, pretty much fused to one assignment. The work of A2 was targeted toward the project goals of A3 and the final project. 
I personally believe that the hardest part was from the first assignment to handling an IFC file in Excel to the third assignment, using ifcopenshell to access data and handle it. Before the course, I didn’t know much about programming, so this helped to develop my programming skills to some extent.
The session of presentations and peer feedback was very educational since it allowed me to review the work of other groups and get feedback for our project. Additionally, I liked a lot the guest lectures from people working on relevant projects or coming from companies.
