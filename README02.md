## Use case: Space Management
We have chosen the Use Case “Space management” with special emphasis on a gross floor areas. Planning gross floor areas in the early stages of a project is essential for several reasons, as it directly impacts the overall design, functionality, cost, and success of the development. With this information the stakeholder might decide whether or not to proceed with a project and see how profitable it might be.
The claim
To efficiently allocate and manage the available gross floor area (GFA) while ensuring optimal utilization of furniture in a given space. The goal is to maximize productivity, ensure regulatory compliance, and maintain a comfortable and functional environment. The claim of gross floor area (GFA) and furniture management relies on comprehensive data from floor plans, furniture inventories, space utilization metrics, regulatory requirements, and cost factors.
